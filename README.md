### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I've been pulled away from learning Web development due to life commitments. This is the first project I've done in a while. It was fun to finish it quite quickly, just in one evening after the child has gone to bed.

My aim for the time being is to try more challenges from Frontend Mentor.



### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - I find this a useful reference to remind of how CSS works. Its quick to find subjects on it.
